There are two scripts that turn PDF to Word.
1. pdf2docs_noword.py -> Doesn't require Word installed, but might have poor quality.
2. pdf2word.py        -> Requires Word. No idea what version, but was working on mine.

Once you run the scrip (either one) for the first time -> it will create 'input' and 
'output' folder.

Then, you can place your pdf files into 'input' and run either of the scripts again.

The files will be in the output.
